I am a grad student starting in Berkeley at 2019. I am interested in various topological phases of matter (such as topological insulators and quantum Hall systems), which embody both the elegance of mathematical structure and the hidden diversity of physics at the quantum scale. I'm recently working on using numerical tools to understand the novel phases in twisted bilayer graphene and other moire materials. As for my trace of life, I grew up in Xi'an, China and finished my undergrad in Peking University.
