## Ongoing Projects

### Monte Carlo simulation of disordered Heisenberg model
Spin models can be used to describe a variety of phenomena in nature. Even exotic states of matter, such as superconducing twisted bilayer graphene, often have a simple description as an effective spin model. In this project, we investigate a particular spin model with disorder to understand whether superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene can survive disorder.
We make a heavy use of computational techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations to tackle this problem. This is complimented with well-known field theory techniques that teach us what kind of phase transitions to expect.
