# How to Join

## Postdoctoral Scholars and Graduate Students
Under construction...
<!-- MIKE SHOULD EDIT THIS.
See members page for contact information. Interested graduate students and and postdoctoral scholars should reach out to the group PI.-->

## Undergraduate Students
Undergraduate students who are interested in getting involved in research in the group should fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/YtSB8uHwJTGNQvZcA) which includes an upload link for a transcript. We will do our best to match you with a suitable project and mentor, but we expect to have far more applications than available projects. The deadline to apply for Spring/Summer 2023 is **Monday, February 13th, 2023**. After this, we will review applications and contact applicants in early March. 

Students should also consult the department [page](https://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-degree/research-opportunities) on research opportunities, funding sources, and deadlines. We would especially like to highlight the Pi2 Summer Scholars Program (https://physics.berkeley.edu/Physics-Innovators-Initiative-Pi2-2023-Summer-Scholars-Program-Information, **also due 02/13/2023**). The Zaletel group is offering a project, "Quantum geometry and the fractional quantum Hall effect", through the Pi2 Summer Scholars Program. **If you are interested in this project, you must separately apply through the Pi2 website.** The department handles the applications for this program separately. 

We also recommend the Berkeley Physics Undergraduate Research Scholars Program (BPURS), Berkeley Connect program, and MPS scholars for semesterly support.
