# How to Join

## Postdoctoral Scholars and Graduate Students
Under construction...
<!-- MIKE SHOULD EDIT THIS.
See members page for contact information. Interested graduate students and and postdoctoral scholars should reach out to the group PI.-->

## Undergraduate Students
Undergraduate students who are interested in getting involved in research in the group should fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/YtSB8uHwJTGNQvZcA) which includes an upload link for a transcript. We will do our best to match you with a suitable project and mentor. Students should also consult the department [page](https://physics.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-degree/research-opportunities) on research opportunities, funding sources, and deadlines. We would especially like to highlight the Pi2 Summer Scholars Program (due date generally in February) and the Berkeley Physics Undergraduate Research Scholars Program (BPURS) for semesterly support.
